# Fibonacci

This is a basic example of a recursive function: fibonnacci. This is the naive,
exponential version of fibonacci: don't call it on a big value!

Currently, only record bindings are recursive. To use a recursive function, one
has to use a record.

## Run

```
$ nickel -f fibonacci.ncl
```
