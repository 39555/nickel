# Nickel Language Server

The Nickel Language Server (NLS) is a [language
server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol) for the
[Nickel](https://www.nickel-lang.org/) programming language. NLS offers error
messages, type hints, and auto-completion right in your favorite LSP-enabled
editor.

NLS is a stand-alone binary. Once built, you must then configure you code editor
to use it for Nickel source files. This document covers building NLS and using
it in VSCode and (Neo)Vim.
